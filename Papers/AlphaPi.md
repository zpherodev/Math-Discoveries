**Title: Alpha Pi: A Discrete Recursive Approximation of Pi/2 Through Symbolic Radial Compensation**

**Author**: C.R. Kunferman

**Abstract**:
This white paper introduces Alpha Pi (denoted απ), a newly derived mathematical constant that approximates π/2 through a discrete symbolic summation. Unlike classical derivations of π which rely on continuous geometry, curvature, or trigonometric identities, Alpha Pi emerges from a recursive grid-based formulation simulating radial compensation in a quantized space. The approach aligns with emerging theories in symbolic mathematics, cellular automata, and discrete physics. Numerical convergence and theoretical motivation are presented, positioning Alpha Pi as a candidate for foundational constants in structure-first mathematical systems.

**1. Introduction**

The constant π has historically been associated with the geometry of circles and the continuous properties of Euclidean space. However, as mathematical physics progresses into symbolic and discrete domains, the need arises for analogs of classical constants derived from first principles of structure rather than curvature. Alpha Pi (απ) serves as such a construct, offering a symbolic and recursive pathway to a value numerically near π/2.

**2. Definition**

Alpha Pi is defined as the following limit:

$$
\alpha\pi = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{2}{n^2} \sum_{j=1}^{n-1} \frac{j^2}{\sqrt{n^2 - j^2}}
$$

Where:

* $n$ is the total number of discrete divisions
* $j$ is the summation index

This formulation simulates a discrete form of radial compensation on a grid-like lattice, approximating the geometric effects of circularity using only symbolic operations.

**3. Motivation and Novelty**

The derivation of Alpha Pi intentionally avoids all geometric curvature, trigonometric identities, or integrals. Instead, it models a synthetic spiral distortion through grid-based ratios of integer squares and radial offsets. The result is a recursive summation that converges numerically to a value near $\frac{\pi}{2}$, but from an entirely different symbolic origin.

This provides a potential constant suitable for symbolic geometry engines, lattice simulations, and computational physics environments operating without a continuous model.

**4. Numerical Convergence**

Computational results for Alpha Pi include:

| n       | Alpha Pi (\u03b1\u03c0) |
| ------- | ----------------------- |
| 100     | 1.3648                  |
| 1,000   | 1.5055                  |
| 10,000  | 1.5501                  |
| 100,000 | 1.5643                  |

Estimated final convergence:

$$
\alpha\pi \approx 1.5642654391586674
$$

This lies approximately 0.0065 below $\frac{\pi}{2} \approx 1.57079632679$.

**5. Applications and Implications**

Alpha Pi may be applied as:

* A quantized symbolic analog of $\pi$
* A constant for discrete curvature models in symbolic geometry
* A scalar for compressed periodic transforms
* A foundational value in grid-native simulation and computation systems
* A prototype for further symbolic constant discovery in emergent math systems

**6. Conclusion**

Alpha Pi demonstrates that structurally emergent constants can numerically approximate classical values like $\pi$ without relying on the assumptions of continuous space. This offers promising implications for symbolic computation, discrete physics, and the evolving ontology of mathematics.
